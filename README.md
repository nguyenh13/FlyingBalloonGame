# Flying Balloon Game

## Author: Hung Nguyen

## 1. About

Flying Balloon is a Flappy Bird clone game written in C# and built in Unity software. The gameplay is as such as simple as the popular Flappy Bird game. To play the game, since the balooon is always flying up, so your job is to use spacebar button or left-click mouse button to control the balloon to control its height so it won't touch and go through the obstacles. 

## 2. Game Mode

There are two modes that you can play are the endless mode and the challenge mode (which is a harder version of the endless mode).
- The endless mode will let you score as much as possible when you don't touch the obstacles
- The challenge mode will be a little bit harder since the obstacles will begin to move upward and downward randomly so that your chances to go through them would be harder

This game is fun when you are playing with your friends, family and challenge together to see who would get the highest score among.
